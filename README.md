# Jose Ortiz-first portfolio

## Description
<p>Welcome to my very first portfolio. This is my second project and has already been my hardest asignment to date. This portfolio is 100% my work and a baseline for the start of my web delveloper career.<p>

## Usage
<p> This website is my highlight of my best work so far and is going to be used to show potential job recriters that I know the technical skills needed to ecxel in this new career. Personaly this website has been the best learning expirence allowing me to apply the knowlege I have aquired in the last few weeks.<p>
<p>The most challenging part of this project was how fast I got lost in my own code. Learning how to plan a web page truely is a great way to guide the html and css sheet.
